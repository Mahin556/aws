### 🔹 **1. What is an AWS Account**

* An **AWS (Amazon Web Services) account** is a unique identity used to access, manage, and pay for AWS cloud resources.
* It’s like your personal or organizational **entry point** into the AWS Cloud.
* Each AWS account has its own:

  * **Billing and usage data**
  * **Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and roles**
  * **Resources** (EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.)
* Every resource you create (like EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda) is owned by a specific account.

---

### 🔹 **2. Account Structure**

* Each AWS account has:

  * **Root user** — the original account owner with full permissions.
  * **IAM users/roles** — created under the account for daily operations.
  * **Account ID** — a unique 12-digit identifier (e.g., `123456789012`).

---

### 🔹 **3. Root User**

* Created when you first sign up for AWS.
* Uses the **email address** and **password** used during registration.
* Has unrestricted access to **all AWS services and billing**.
* Should be used **only for critical tasks** like:

  * Changing billing details
  * Closing the account
  * Managing root MFA
  * IAM
  * All resources.
* AWS recommends:

  * **Enabling MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for root
  * **Not using it for daily operations**
  * **Creating IAM users** for regular work

---

### 🔹 **4. IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

* IAM is how AWS controls **who can access what** in your account.
* Global service
* user can work on each region, create EC2 in every region unless Policy not allow to create.
* Components:

  * **Users:** Individual identities with login credentials.
    * difference from application level users(RDS,EC2)
  * **Groups:** Collection of users with common permissions.
    *When permissions are copied from an existing user who is part of one or more groups and inherits permissions from those groups, the new user is automatically added to the same groups and inherits the same permissions.
  * **Roles:** Identities assigned to applications or services (no permanent credentials).
  * **Policies:** JSON-based permission rules that define actions users or roles can take.
* Example:
  You can create a user `developer1` and attach a policy that allows only S3 and EC2 read access.

---

### 🔹 **5. AWS Account Regions and Availability Zones**

* AWS resources are hosted in **Regions** (geographical locations, e.g., `us-east-1`, `ap-south-1`).
* Each region has multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)** for redundancy and fault tolerance.
* Some resources are **global** (e.g., IAM, CloudFront, Route 53) while others are **region-specific** (e.g., EC2, RDS, S3 buckets).

---

### 🔹 **6. AWS Account Identifiers**

* Each account has:

  * A **12-digit Account ID** (e.g., `123456789012`)
  * A **canonical user ID**
  * An **alias** (optional custom name instead of the numeric ID)
* You can view these in the AWS Management Console under “My Account”.

---

### 🔹 **7. Billing and Payment**

* Each account maintains its own **billing data** unless consolidated under an organization.
* You can:

  * View detailed **usage reports**
  * Set **budgets and alarms** with AWS Budgets
  * Enable **Cost Explorer** to track costs visually
* **Free Tier:** Every new account gets limited free access to many services for 12 months.

---

### 🔹 **8. Multi-Account Management (AWS Organizations)**

* **AWS Organizations** allows you to manage **multiple AWS accounts** from a single management account (formerly called master account).
* Benefits:

  * Centralized billing
  * Policy control across accounts using **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**
  * Easier account isolation (e.g., dev, test, prod)
* Typical structure:

  * **Management account**: handles billing and organization settings.
  * **Member accounts**: used for projects, teams, or environments.
* Example:

  ```
  Organization Root
  ├── Dev Account
  ├── Test Account
  └── Prod Account
  ```

---

### 🔹 **9. Security Best Practices**

* **Enable MFA** for both root and IAM users.
* **Use IAM roles** instead of static access keys.
* **Rotate credentials regularly**.
* **Enable CloudTrail** to log all API actions.
* **Use AWS Config** to track resource configurations.
* **Restrict root usage** — never use it for daily operations.

---

### 🔹 **10. Accessing AWS Account**

* **AWS Management Console:** Web interface for managing services.
* **AWS CLI:** Command-line tool to manage AWS programmatically.
* **AWS SDKs:** Libraries to interact with AWS from code (Python, Java, Node.js, etc.).
* **AWS API:** RESTful API for direct integration.

---

### 🔹 **11. Account-Level Services**

* **Billing & Cost Management**
* **Consolidated Billing (via AWS Organizations)**
* **Support Plans** (Basic, Developer, Business, Enterprise)
* **Trusted Advisor** (security and cost optimization recommendations)
* **Security Hub** (centralized compliance view)

---

### 🔹 **12. Deleting or Closing an AWS Account**

* Only the **root user** can close the account.
* Steps:

  * Sign in as root → Go to **My Account** → Click **Close Account**.
* AWS retains data for a short period before permanent deletion.
* Ensure you **delete all resources** (like EC2, S3) before closure to avoid unexpected charges.

---

### 🔹 **13. AWS Account Limits**

* Each account has default **service limits (quotas)**, e.g.:

  * 20 EC2 instances per region
  * 100 S3 buckets per account
* You can request **limit increases** from the AWS Support Center.

---

### 🔹 **14. Linking Accounts to AWS Organizations**

* You can **invite existing AWS accounts** or **create new ones** under your organization.
* Consolidated billing helps **combine usage** for discounts (like EC2 or S3 volume pricing).
* You can apply **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** to restrict actions across accounts.

---

### 🔹 **15. Real-World Example**

Imagine your company has three environments:

* **Dev:** For development testing.
* **Test:** For QA and staging.
* **Prod:** For production workloads.
  You create three separate AWS accounts and manage them under **AWS Organizations**:
* Each account has its own IAM setup, VPC, and resources.
* Billing is consolidated under the main organization.
* SCPs restrict Dev/Test from accessing production databases.
