### ⚙️ **1. Definition**

* **Root User:**
  The *original account owner* created when you first sign up for AWS. It’s tied directly to the AWS account’s email address.
* **IAM Admin User:**
  A user *created under* the AWS account using the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, usually granted `AdministratorAccess` permissions.

---

### 🔑 **2. Access Level**

* **Root User:** Has **unlimited access** to *everything* in the AWS account — no exceptions.
  It can perform **every single action**, even ones that IAM users can’t.
* **IAM Admin User:** Has **almost full access**, but only as defined by its **permissions policy** (for example, `AdministratorAccess` policy).
  AWS can still restrict some actions for IAM users, even admins.

---

### 🧩 **3. Actions Only the Root User Can Do**

Even an IAM Admin user **cannot** do these — only the Root user can:

* Change or close the AWS account.
* Change the root user’s email address.
* Change payment methods, view or modify billing information (unless explicitly granted via “Billing Access”).
* Restore IAM user access if locked out.
* Enable or disable MFA on the root account.
* Sign up for some AWS GovCloud accounts.
* Modify certain AWS Support plans (like upgrading to Enterprise).
* Request AWS account recovery.

---

### 🧱 **4. How They Are Authenticated**

* **Root User:** Signs in using the **email address** and password used to create the AWS account.
* **IAM Admin User:** Signs in using an **account ID or alias**, plus their **username and password**.

Example:

* Root login: `email@example.com`
* IAM user login: `123456789012` (account ID) → username: `admin`

---

### 🧍‍♂️ **5. Best Practice**

* **Root user should NOT be used for daily tasks.**
* Root user should:

  * Enable **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**.
  * Be used **only for rare administrative tasks** (like billing, account recovery, or MFA setup).
* Create an **IAM Admin user** with `AdministratorAccess` for all day-to-day administrative work.
