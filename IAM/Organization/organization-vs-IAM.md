### **1. Purpose**

* **AWS Organizations**
  • Used to manage **multiple AWS accounts** under one umbrella.
  • Focuses on **account-level management**, governance, and billing consolidation.
  • Lets you group accounts into **Organizational Units (OUs)** and apply high-level policies (SCPs).

* **AWS IAM**
  • Used to manage **users, groups, roles, and permissions** within a **single AWS account**.
  • Focuses on **identity and access control** to AWS resources inside that account.
  • Controls *who* can perform *what actions* on *which resources*.

---

### **2. Scope**

* **Organizations** → operates at the **account level** (multi-account scope).
* **IAM** → operates at the **resource level** within a single account.

---

### **3. Management Level**

* **Organizations** → manages multiple AWS accounts together from a **central management account**.
* **IAM** → manages access *within* one AWS account, including policies for users and roles.

---

### **4. Policies Used**

* **AWS Organizations** → uses **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**.
  • SCPs define the *maximum permissions* allowed for any account or OU.
  • They do **not** grant permissions; they only restrict them.
  • Example: Deny use of EC2 service in all dev accounts.

* **IAM** → uses **IAM policies** (inline, managed, or resource-based).
  • These directly grant permissions to IAM users, roles, or groups.
  • Example: Allow user “John” to start EC2 instances.

---

### **5. Example Use Case**

* **Organizations**
  • A company has 10 AWS accounts: one for production, one for testing, one for dev, etc.
  • Using AWS Organizations, they centrally manage billing, enforce policies (e.g., disallow creating IAM users in all accounts), and organize them into OUs.

* **IAM**
  • Inside the production account, create IAM roles and policies to control who can access S3 buckets, launch EC2 instances, etc.

---

### **6. Type of Control**

* **Organizations** → applies **governance controls** across multiple accounts.
* **IAM** → applies **permission controls** for users/roles/resources.

---

### **7. Hierarchy**

* **Organizations**
  Management Account → Organizational Units (OUs) → Member Accounts → SCPs

* **IAM**
  Account → Users / Groups / Roles → IAM Policies

---

### **8. Integration**

* IAM and Organizations work **together**:
  • SCPs (from Organizations) define the upper boundary of permissions.
  • IAM policies (inside each account) define what’s actually allowed.
  → **Effective permissions = IAM Policy ∩ SCP Policy**

---

### **9. Centralized Billing**

* **Organizations** → Yes, consolidated billing for all member accounts.
* **IAM** → No billing capability; it’s only for identity and access control.

---

### **10. Multi-account Automation**

* **Organizations** → You can create, invite, or remove AWS accounts programmatically (via API).
* **IAM** → Cannot create AWS accounts; it only manages entities *within* an account.

---

### **11. Security and Governance Focus**

* **Organizations** → focuses on **governance, compliance, and financial control**.
* **IAM** → focuses on **authentication, authorization, and resource access**.

---

### **12. Example Analogy**

* **AWS Organizations** = A company’s headquarters managing multiple branches (each branch = AWS account).
* **IAM** = The internal employee management system of each branch controlling which employee can enter which room.
