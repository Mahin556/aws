### **1. Use a Multi-Account Strategy**

* Create **separate AWS accounts** for different purposes (e.g., Production, Development, Security, Logging, Sandbox).
* Benefits:
  • Reduces blast radius if one account is compromised.
  • Simplifies billing and cost tracking.
  • Enables different compliance and access policies per environment.

---

### **2. Design a Clear Organizational Unit (OU) Structure**

* Group accounts into **Organizational Units (OUs)** based on environment, business function, or compliance needs.
  Example structure:

  ```
  Root
  ├── Security OU
  │   ├── Logging Account
  │   └── Audit Account
  ├── Infrastructure OU
  │   ├── Networking Account
  ├── Sandbox OU
  │   ├── Dev Account
  │   ├── Test Account
  └── Production OU
      ├── Prod-App1 Account
      ├── Prod-App2 Account
  ```
* Benefits:
  • Easier to apply policies at OU level.
  • Clear isolation between environments.

---

### **3. Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) Wisely**

* SCPs define the **maximum permissions** accounts can have — they don’t grant permissions themselves.
* Use SCPs to:
  • Deny dangerous or non-compliant actions globally (e.g., `Deny access to regions not used`).
  • Enforce MFA requirement for sensitive operations.
  • Prevent disabling CloudTrail, GuardDuty, or Config.
  • Restrict creation of IAM users (enforce IAM roles + SSO).
* Always test SCPs on a **sandbox account** before applying to production.

---

### **4. Enable Consolidated Billing**

* Consolidate billing under the **management account** for cost transparency and discounts (volume pricing, Savings Plans).
* Use **Cost Explorer**, **Budgets**, and **Cost Anomaly Detection** for monitoring.
* Tag accounts and resources consistently for chargeback or cost allocation.

---

### **5. Secure the Management Account**

* Never use the **management account** for workloads.
* Restrict access to a few trusted administrators.
* Enable **MFA** for all users.
* Only use to billing and account creation.
* Protect root credentials — don’t use them for daily tasks.
* Configure **CloudTrail** and **AWS Config** for visibility.

---

### **6. Centralize Security and Logging**

* Create dedicated **security** and **logging** accounts.
  • Send all CloudTrail logs, Config logs, and GuardDuty findings to a **central logging account**.
  • Enable **AWS Security Hub** and **GuardDuty** across all accounts and aggregate results centrally.
* Use **AWS Config Aggregator** to view compliance across all accounts.

---

### **7. Use AWS Control Tower (If Possible)**

* Use **Control Tower** to automate multi-account setup, OU structure, SCPs, and guardrails.
* Provides best-practice blueprints and central dashboards.
* Great for large enterprises managing dozens of accounts.

---

### **8. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege**

* Combine **SCPs + IAM + Permissions Boundaries** to ensure users and services only have necessary permissions.
* Use **AWS SSO** (IAM Identity Center) for centralized access management.
* Regularly review IAM roles and permissions in all member accounts.

---

### **9. Enforce Region and Service Restrictions**

* Use SCPs to **limit access to approved AWS regions** to reduce compliance risk.
* Deny use of unnecessary or high-risk services (e.g., personal email notification services, root account operations).

---

### **10. Use Tag Policies and Naming Standards**

* Enforce consistent **tagging policies** for all accounts (e.g., `Owner`, `Environment`, `CostCenter`).
* Helps with cost tracking, automation, and compliance.

---

### **11. Automate Account Creation and Management**

* Use **AWS Organizations APIs** or **Control Tower Account Factory** to create accounts programmatically.
* Automatically apply baseline SCPs, Config rules, and CloudWatch alarms.

---

### **12. Centralize Identity with AWS SSO (IAM Identity Center)**

* Integrate AWS SSO with Organizations for centralized authentication and role assignment.
* Connect with identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) or Okta.
* Simplifies onboarding/offboarding across multiple accounts.

---

### **13. Enable Cross-Account Access via Roles**

* Use IAM roles with cross-account trust to allow access between accounts.
* Example: Security account can assume a role in all member accounts for auditing.

---

### **14. Monitor and Audit Continuously**

* Enable **AWS CloudTrail** organization-wide logging.
* Aggregate all trails to the logging account.
* Use **AWS Config**, **Security Hub**, and **Trusted Advisor** to detect issues.
* Regularly review SCP effectiveness and IAM usage reports.

---

### **15. Plan for Growth and Scalability**

* Expect new accounts as teams or projects expand.
* Keep OUs and policies flexible for future scaling.
* Document account purpose and policy rules.

---

### **16. Keep Organization Root Clean**

* Avoid attaching policies directly to the **root** organization node.
* Apply policies to specific OUs instead — this limits unintended restrictions on all accounts.
