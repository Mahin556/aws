### üîπ Concept Overview

| Type          | Also Known As | Meaning                                               | Behavior                                           |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blacklist** | Deny list     | Block only *specific* actions, services, or resources | Everything is allowed **except** what‚Äôs denied     |
| **Whitelist** | Allow list    | Explicitly allow only *specific* actions or services  | Everything is **denied by default** unless allowed |

---

### üîπ 1. **Blacklist (Deny List) Strategy**

**How it works:**

* You start with a **FullAWSAccess** policy (everything allowed).
* Then add **specific Deny statements** to block unwanted actions or services.
* AWS evaluates SCPs in a way that *explicit Deny* always overrides any Allow from IAM policies.

**Example (Blacklist SCP):**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:TerminateInstances",
        "s3:DeleteBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Meaning:**

* Everything else is allowed, except terminating EC2 instances and deleting S3 buckets.

**Advantages:**

* Easy to manage ‚Äî only deny known dangerous or costly actions.
* Good for large organizations that need flexibility.
* Works well when you want to ‚Äúrestrict a few things‚Äù in otherwise open environments (e.g., Dev or Sandbox).

**Disadvantages:**

* Risk of missing new or risky services (you must keep updating your Deny list).
* Harder to ensure full compliance ‚Äî something unblocked might cause exposure.

---

### üîπ 2. **Whitelist (Allow List) Strategy**

**How it works:**

* You start by denying everything (`"Effect": "Deny", "Action": "*"`) ‚Äî either explicitly or by *not allowing anything*.
* Then you create an SCP with `"Effect": "Allow"` for only the services/actions you explicitly want to permit.
* Everything else stays denied because SCPs limit the maximum allowed actions.

**Example (Whitelist SCP):**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*",
        "cloudwatch:*",
        "ec2:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Meaning:**

* Only S3, CloudWatch, and EC2 Describe actions are allowed.
* All other actions and services are implicitly denied.

**Advantages:**

* Strongest security model ‚Äî nothing is accessible unless explicitly permitted.
* Perfect for **high-security environments** (production, regulated industries).
* Easier to meet compliance requirements (ISO, HIPAA, etc.).

**Disadvantages:**

* Harder to manage ‚Äî every new service you want to use must be manually added.
* Can break workflows if a service isn‚Äôt listed.
* Not ideal for fast-moving dev/test environments.

### üîπ 3. **Real-World Analogy**

| Concept              | Blacklist                                      | Whitelist                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Airport security** | Let everyone in except people on a no-fly list | Only let in people with boarding passes      |
| **Firewall rules**   | Block only certain ports or IPs                | Allow only specific ports or IPs             |
| **SCP strategy**     | Deny risky services (e.g., CloudTrail delete)  | Allow only approved services (e.g., S3, EC2) |

---

### üîπ 4. **How They Apply in AWS SCP**

| Strategy      | Default Behavior | Typical Use Case                            | Example OU                 |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Blacklist** | Allow everything | Broadly permissive with security guardrails | Dev/Test OUs               |
| **Whitelist** | Deny everything  | Strictly controlled environments            | Production, Compliance OUs |

---

### üîπ 5. **Example Comparison**

**Blacklist SCP:**

```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:TerminateInstances",
    "cloudtrail:DeleteTrail",
    "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

‚û° Everything works except these risky actions.

**Whitelist SCP:**

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:*",
    "ec2:Describe*"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

‚û° Only S3 operations and EC2 describe calls work ‚Äî all else blocked.

### üîπ 6. **Best Practice Recommendation**

| Environment                     | Recommended Strategy          | Reason                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sandbox / Dev**               | **Blacklist**                 | Developers need flexibility; just block expensive or dangerous actions. |
| **Test / QA**                   | **Hybrid (mostly blacklist)** | Allow testing but deny destructive actions.                             |
| **Production / Compliance**     | **Whitelist**                 | Ensure only approved services run; no accidental exposure.              |
| **Security / Logging accounts** | **Whitelist**                 | Restrict to logging and monitoring services only.                       |

---

### üîπ 7. **Hybrid Strategy (Most Common in Enterprises)**

Many large AWS environments use a **hybrid** approach:

* **Root-level SCP:** broad Deny for universally risky actions (CloudTrail delete, disabling GuardDuty, root use).
* **OU-level SCP:** environment-specific rules ‚Äî blacklist for Dev, whitelist for Prod.

Example structure:

```
Root
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Security OU ‚Üí Whitelist SCP
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Prod OU ‚Üí Whitelist SCP
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dev OU ‚Üí Blacklist SCP
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sandbox OU ‚Üí Blacklist SCP
```
